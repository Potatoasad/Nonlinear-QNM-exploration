# Nonlinearities in QNMs
Just exploring some stuff in the `/notebooks` on non linearity in QNMs. Looking at the recent papers: arxiv2208.07379 , arxiv:2208.07374 and arxiv:2208.07380


## Usage
#### Initial Install
First add whatever packages you will need inside the `requirements.txt`

Then:
```bash
make install  #installs everything and creates the environment
```
You only need to do this once (or whenever you add another package to `requirements.txt`)

#### Running the notebook
Once installed, you can simply run:

```bash
./jupyter lab # launches jupyter lab in that environment, you could do ./jupyter notebook too
```

Then in the jupyter notebook you can do whatever you want.
